# 2d-collision-simulator
A simple 2d collision simulator written in OpenGL/C++.

This is a very simple environment with 2d circle-circle and circle-square collisions. There are features like artificial gravity, a factor for bounciness, initial velocity, etc. that are all easily modified from the code itself.

To start, clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio. Run the project and an empty screen should show up. Right click for a menu to appear, hit run to start the simulation.
